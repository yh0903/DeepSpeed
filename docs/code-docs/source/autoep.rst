AutoEP (Automatic Expert Parallelism)
=====================================

AutoEP automatically detects MoE layers in Hugging Face models and replaces them
with EP-enabled versions, requiring zero model code changes. It follows the
pattern of AutoTP (Automatic Tensor Parallelism).

This API is separate from the explicit ``deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE`` layer API.
For the explicit DeepSpeed MoE layer API, see :doc:`moe`.

**Built-in AutoEP presets:** ``mixtral`` (Mixtral), ``qwen3_moe`` (Qwen3-MoE),
``qwen3_5_moe`` (Qwen3.5-MoE), ``deepseek_v2`` (DeepSeek-V2), and
``deepseek_v3`` (DeepSeek-V3).

The preset name means AutoEP knows the router, expert, and weight naming
patterns for that model family. Running a Hugging Face model also requires a
Transformers build that exposes the matching config/model classes,
``model.config.model_type`` value, and fused expert layout.

.. list-table:: AutoEP preset compatibility by Transformers version
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Preset
     - Minimum Transformers version
     - Notes
   * - ``mixtral``
     - ``5.0.0``
     -
   * - ``qwen3_moe``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - Also covers Qwen2-MoE when the installed Transformers build uses the
       validated fused expert layout. Qwen3-MoE classes appear in ``4.51.3``,
       but the tested ``4.x`` builds do not match the validated AutoEP layout.
   * - ``qwen3_5_moe``
     - ``5.2.0``
     - Requires the Qwen3.5 text-backbone ``qwen3_5_moe_text`` model type;
       for performance on Qwen3.5's Gated DeltaNet layers, install optimized
       kernels. See the `Hugging Face Transformers kernel loading docs
       <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/kernel_doc/loading_kernels>`__
       and the `Qwen FlashQLA blog <https://qwen.ai/blog?id=flashqla>`__.
   * - ``deepseek_v2``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - ``load_balance_coeff`` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing
       is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected.
   * - ``deepseek_v3``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - ``load_balance_coeff`` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing
       is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected.

**ZeRO compatibility:** Stages 0, 1, and 2, plus constrained Stage 3
support. Stage 3 requires AutoEP-managed MoE layers and does not support native
DeepSpeed MoE layers, AutoTP, tensor model parallelism from ``mpu``, sequence
parallelism, MiCS, hpZeRO secondary tensor groups, non-1 expert tensor
parallelism, or quantized gradients. Stage 3 AutoEP checkpoints are saved
partition-natively in the ``zero_pp_rank_*`` shard files and support
same-topology load, module-only loads (``load_module_only``),
optimizer-state-free loads (``load_optimizer_states=False``), and Universal
Checkpoint conversion. Optimizer-including Universal Checkpoint loads can
resume with a different data-parallel world size, a different ``autoep_size``,
or both, when the target ``autoep_size`` divides the model's expert count.
Weights-only/module-only Universal Checkpoint loads use the converted
``fp32.pt`` parameter files and support the same data-parallel and
``autoep_size`` topology changes.

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "expert_parallel": {
            "enabled": true,
            "autoep_size": 4,
            "preset_model": "mixtral"
        }
    }

**How it works:**

1. During ``deepspeed.initialize()``, AutoEP scans the model for MoE layers
   using preset-defined patterns (router name, expert name, weight shapes).
2. Detected MoE blocks are replaced with ``AutoEPMoELayer``, which uses
   TorchTitan's grouped GEMM kernels and AllToAll token dispatch.
3. EP/EDP process groups are created automatically based on ``autoep_size``.
4. Expert parameters are marked for expert-data-parallel gradient reduction;
   router and shared-expert parameters use standard data-parallel reduction.

**Communication backend (optional):**

The expert AllToAll can be carried by `DeepEP <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP>`__
instead of the default collectives. This is opt-in and off by default; jobs
that set nothing keep the existing path unchanged.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "expert_parallel": {
        "enabled": true,
        "autoep_size": 8,
        "comm_backend": "deepep",
        "comm_num_sm": 12,
        "comm_qp_margin": 4,
        "comm_max_tokens_per_rank": 4096
      }
    }

- ``comm_backend``: ``"comm"`` (default) uses ``deepspeed.comm`` collectives;
  ``"deepep"`` uses DeepEP's dispatch and combine kernels.
- ``comm_num_sm``: SMs given to communication. Default 12.
- ``comm_qp_margin``: RDMA queue pairs reserved beyond one per SM. Default 4.
- ``comm_max_tokens_per_rank``: largest per-rank token count the job will
  produce, which is ``micro_batch_size * seq_len`` when sequences are padded to
  a fixed length. Required when ``comm_backend`` is ``"deepep"`` because the
  DeepEP buffer is sized statically and must use the same capacity on every
  rank. A batch that exceeds it is an error.

For ``autoep_size > 1``, DeepEP receives the router output directly, bypassing
the collective backend's sorting, token expansion, and split-count exchange.
Shared experts and router-logit outputs retain the same behavior. The EP
communicator is initialized once before each layer's first DeepEP buffer is
constructed, including when the caller supplied a lazily initialized process
group. This initialization does not run on subsequent forwards. The standard
``comm`` and ``autoep_size=1`` paths are unchanged.

**Python cyclic GC policy (experimental):**

Large Python model graphs can accumulate cyclic objects during training. A
generation-2 collection pauses one rank's Python thread, and the pause can then
be exposed as collective wait time on every expert-parallel rank. AutoEP offers
an opt-in policy that collects once after engine initialization and disables
automatic cyclic collection until the engine is destroyed:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "expert_parallel": {
        "enabled": true,
        "autoep_size": 8,
        "python_gc_policy": "disable_during_training"
      }
    }

The default is ``"default"``, which leaves Python GC unchanged. The policy is
process-wide and reference-counted across DeepSpeed engines. Applications that
create cyclic Python objects during training should call
``engine.collect_python_gc()`` at a safe boundary such as after checkpointing.
Call ``engine.destroy()`` when the engine is no longer needed to restore the
process's original automatic-GC state; restoration does not rely on Python
finalization because disabled cyclic GC cannot reclaim engine reference cycles.

On 16 H100s across two nodes, replaying routing captured from real training,
DeepEP reduced payload AllToAll time from roughly 100 ms to 48 ms per step. A
full SFT step on Qwen3.5-MoE went from roughly 325 ms to 266 ms, a 1.2x speedup
that removes about 18% of the step, reproduced across two independent jobs
(1.21x and 1.24x). Both backends are measured in the same job, on the same pods
and alternating, since the same measurement varied by a quarter between jobs;
the figures are medians rather than single observations, and DeepEP's own
median moved by 0.3% between the two jobs while the collective baseline moved
by 2.5%. The advantage grows with routing imbalance: at the most skewed
step measured, the collective path degraded to 116 ms while DeepEP stayed flat.

``comm_num_sm`` matters because communication competes with the expert GEMM for
SMs. The default of 12 was chosen by measuring whole steps: 8 SMs gave a median
297.9 ms against 265.4 ms at 12, and larger budgets were slower again.
``comm_qp_margin`` exists because DeepEP's automatic queue-pair count assumes
it is alone on the fabric, which exhausts the queue pairs ZeRO and the
data-parallel groups have already claimed in a training step.

Requirements and limits:

- The ``deep_ep`` package must be installed. It is imported only when this
  backend is selected, so installations without it are unaffected.
- DeepEP v2 requires NCCL 2.30.4 or newer, built with GIN support. Below that
  version the transport is unavailable regardless of the network.
- DeepEP v1 (the legacy ``Buffer`` API, using NVSHMEM and IBGDA) is not
  supported.
- bfloat16 only. DeepEP's dispatch kernel takes bfloat16 rows, so selecting
  this backend for an fp16 or fp32 run is rejected rather than silently
  downgraded.
- Not compatible with folded tensor parallelism
  (``expert_tensor_parallel_size > 1``), which is rejected at setup.

**Fused weighted restore (experimental):**

After the combine all-to-all, AutoEP holds one row per routed assignment and has
to turn it back into one row per token. ``combine_impl`` selects how:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "expert_parallel": {
            "enabled": true,
            "autoep_size": 16,
            "preset_model": "qwen3_moe",
            "combine_impl": "fused_weighted_sum"
        }
    }

``"auto"`` (default) resolves to ``"weighted_sum"``, which scatters the rows into
a zero-filled ``[tokens * top_k, hidden]`` buffer, widens it to FP32 to apply the
routing weights, and reduces over top-k. ``"fused_weighted_sum"`` computes the
same result in a single pass: each program owns one token and one slice of the
hidden dimension, walks its top-k rows in registers and accumulates in FP32, so
neither the scattered buffer nor the FP32 intermediate is allocated. At the
canonical shape the FP32 intermediate alone is 64 MiB per layer.

Routing weights are still accumulated in FP32 and cast once, so the result
matches the eager reduction to within the order of the top-k summation. Only the
reduction changes: the collectives, the router, the grouped GEMM and the
expert-major reorder are untouched.

``"fused_weighted_sum"`` is rejected, rather than quietly ignored, when it would
have nothing to replace or would change semantics:

- ``tensor_parallel.autotp_size`` greater than 1, which uses folded tensor
  parallelism and restores combined tokens from assignment metadata instead;
- ``expert_tensor_parallel_size`` greater than 1;
- ``comm_backend="deepep"`` with expert parallelism, because DeepEP already
  restores and reduces its routed rows;
- a resolved ``score_apply`` other than ``"post"``;
- activations that are not bfloat16, float16, or float32, a non-CUDA device, or
  a build without Triton.

Failing fast matters for measurement: a run that asked for the fused reduction
and silently got the eager one would report the difference between an
implementation and itself.

**Constraints:**

- ``autoep_size`` must divide ``num_experts`` for all detected MoE layers.
- ``autoep_size=1`` is valid: all experts remain local (no AllToAll), useful
  for functional testing on a single GPU.
- AutoEP currently cannot be combined with AutoTP
  (``tensor_parallel.autotp_size > 1``) or tensor model parallelism from
  ``mpu``; support is planned as follow-up work.
- AutoEP with ZeRO Stage 3 is supported only without sequence parallelism,
  MiCS, hpZeRO secondary tensor groups, non-1 expert tensor parallelism, or
  quantized gradients.
- Regular checkpoint save/load requires matching ``autoep_size``. To change
  ``autoep_size`` or data-parallel world size across runs for the same
  AutoEP-detected model topology, convert the checkpoint to Universal
  Checkpoint format and load it with ``checkpoint.load_universal``; see the
  `Universal Checkpointing tutorial </tutorials/universal-checkpointing/>`__
  for the detailed flow and constraints.
- DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-V3 AutoEP do not support load-balance expert bias
  yet. The built-in DeepSeek presets disable it by default; explicit non-null
  values fail.
